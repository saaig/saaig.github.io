                                <p>It was at that moment that Peter understood. The existence of a perfect being was irrational in                                      itself. It was not something that could be created by another imperfect creature but instead had to stem                                from the ideas of an even higher being. Yet, would being perfect itself even be enough to create a                                      perfect being? Was it not required of the creator to be something greater, something beyond perfection?                                  Something that by definition should not exist?</p>

Peter could clearly see the outlines of the child illuminated by the headlights of the approaching car. Whenever people explained their reasoning for endangering their own lives in order to save children their explanations usually mentioned the children still having their whole life ahead of him - but Peter wasn't old himself, he also hopefully still had the better part of his life still ahead of him. "Otherwise this would have been a very disappointing journey indeed", he noted inside his mind. The thought itself caused him to smirk slightly. How was he to determine if the child was worth saving anyways? What if the child was destined to amount to nothing while Peter would go on to do great things? And what if the opposite was the case? For all he knew it wasn't exactly likely that either of those possibilities would happen, yet the question remained: Who was the one that deserved to live? The one that would further benefit society? </br>
Somehow, the feeling overcame him that this was not the right question to ask and just as it became clear that Peter would not arrive at a decision, time started moving again, as quickly as it had stopped. Peter stared at the intersection waiting for the inevitable disaster to strike.</p>
